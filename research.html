						<h2>Research Areas in DBWeb</h2>
					</header>
					<div id="contentlarge">
<p>The DBWeb Team does research in the following areas:</p>
<h2>Ontologies and Knowledge Management</h2>An ontology is a computer-processable collection of knowledge
		about the world.
		In the DBWeb team, we are concerned with RDF Ontologies -- i.e. with
		ontologies in the form of graphs.
		We construct and mine such ontologies.
	<ul>
<li style="clear:right">
<a class="image" href="http://yago-knowledge.org">
	<img style="float:right; width:30%; border: none; padding: 0em 2em 0.5em;" src="http://dbweb.enst.fr/research/logos/yago.svg" alt="Logo of YAGO"></a><a href="http://yago-knowledge.org">YAGO</a>:
			YAGO is a large ontology constructed from WordNet, Wikipedia, and
			other sources.
			We develop YAGO together with the
			<a href="http://mpii.de/departments/d5">Database department</a>
			of the
			<a href="http://mpii.de">Max Planck Institute for Informatics</a>
			in Germany.
		</li>
<li style="clear:right">
<a href="http://mpii.de/departments/ontologies/projects/amie">AMIE</a>:
			AMIE is a project to learn patterns and rules in ontologies.
			We conduct this project	together with the
			<a href="http://mpii.de/departments/d5">Database department</a>
			of the
			<a href="http://mpii.de">Max Planck Institute for Informatics</a>
			in Germany.
		</li>
<li style="clear:right">
<a href="http://webdam.inria.fr/paris">PARIS</a>:
			PARIS is a project to learn mappings between ontologies. This
			initiative was born in the
			<a href="http://webdam.inria.fr">Webdam</a>
			project.
											</li>
<li style="clear:right">
<a href="http://resources.mpi-inf.mpg.de/d5/ibex/">IBEX</a>:
												IBEX is an approach to harvest entities such as people, commercial products, or books from the Web.
												We developed IBEX together with the <a href="http://mpii.de">Max Planck Institute for Informatics</a>
												in Germany.
											 </li>
<li style="clear:right">
<a href="http://suchanek.name/programs/divina">DIVINA</a>:
												 DIVINA doesn't have anything to do with ontologies. It just helps people find out whether their online accounts are secure.
											 </li>
</ul>
<h2>Large Scale Data Mining</h2>Graphs are a near-universal way to represent data. We are
		concerned with mining graphs for patterns and properties.
		Our particular focus is on the scalability of such approaches.
	<ul>
<li style="clear:right">Graph Mining:
			We are concerned generally with mining properties of graphs.
		</li>
<li style="clear:right">EUQLID:
			The EUQLID project investigates novel methods for managing and mining
			graph data.
		</li>
<li style="clear:right">Chair Big Data:
			The Chair "Big Data and E-commerce Applications" is concerned with
			recommender systems,
			large graphs management and mining.
		</li>
<li style="clear:right">NormAtis:
			The NormAtis project is concerned with Web information extraction, data
			integration, uncertain data management.
		</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Social Web</h2>
		The Web has evolved more and more into a
		<em>social Web</em>
		: content is produced and shared by users.
		In the DBWeb team, we follow and anticipate developments in this area.
	<ul>
<li style="clear:right">
<a class="image" href="http://dbweb.enst.fr/research/arcomem/index.html"><img style="float:right; width:30%; border: none; padding: 0em 2em 0.5em;" src="http://dbweb.enst.fr/research/logos/arcomem.png" alt="Logo of ARCOMEM"></a><a href="http://dbweb.enst.fr/research/arcomem/index.html">ARCOMEM</a>:
			Arcomem is about memory institutions like archives, museums, and libraries
			in the age of the Social Web.
			The project aims to transform archives into collective memories that
			are more tightly integrated with their
			community of users and to exploit Social Web and the wisdom of crowds to make
			Web archiving a more selective
			and meaning-based process
		</li>
<li style="clear:right">Community detection:
			We are investigating means to detect and distinguish social
			communities on the Web.
		</li>
<li style="clear:right">Social Relations:
			We investigate the optimal investment in social relations from a
			theoretical point of view.
		</li>
<li style="clear:right">NormAtis:
			The NormAtis project is concerned with Web information extraction, data
			integration, uncertain data management.
		</li>
</ul>
<h2>Language and relevance</h2>Computer science is not just about computers. In this area of
		research, we investigate how humans reason,
		and what this implies for machines.
	<ul>
<li style="clear:right">
<a href="http://www.simplicitytheory.org/">Simplicity Theory</a>:
			Simplicity theory is a cognitive theory that seeks to explain the
			attractiveness of situations or events
			to human minds.
		</li>
<li style="clear:right">Natural Language and cognition:
			We investigate semantics and relevance from a cognitive science point
			of view.
